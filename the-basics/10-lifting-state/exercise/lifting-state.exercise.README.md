# The Basics - Lifting State - Exercise

You've been tasked to add a second input field for fluid ounces. The acceptance criteria are as follows:

    - There can only be one "Keep going!" or "You've drank an entire gallon!" message.
    - That message must exist outside the fieldset(s).
    - When one input is updated the other input automatically updates with the proper value for its conversion.
        *If I type 5 in the cups input, 40 should display in the ounces input, and vice versa.*
    - The message updates automatically regardless of which input is typed.

Basically, it operates very similar to the sample application.
