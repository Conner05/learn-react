        SUMMARY:
        Introducing state and lifecycle methods. In this ticking clock example we'll transform 
        the clock into a reusable component that is encapsulated.

        TODO:
        -   refactor the element to its own Component that accepts props with a date property
            and render that in place of element, passing the date prop.
            -   the problem we still have is that the updating of the clock still happens outside
                the component (setInterval()). That ough to be an implementation detail of the
                component itself.
        -   convert the Clock component to a class (if you made it a function) and introduce state
            in place of the date prop - https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
        -   after that's done, we now need to have the class component run the setInterval()
            -   this is where mounting comes in. React class component's have two lifecycle
                methods: componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount(), the first for when the
                component is rendered, and the second for when it is destroyed.
            -   we will use the componentDidMount() method to implement our timer (setInterval())
            -   since setInterval() has a return value, we'll be sure to set it as a variable on
                the class so we can use the clearInterval() method in componentWillUnmount()

    function tick() {
        const element = <div><h2>Time: {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</h2></div>
        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
    }
    setInterval(tick, 1000);
